## Overview
This ROS2 Stereo Visual Odometry package facilitates the development and testing of stereo visual odometry systems by providing a highly customizable framework. Users can easily interchange feature extractors, trackers, and optimizers thanks to its template-based design. This package leverages popular libraries such as Sophus, g2o, Ceres, and OpenCV, focusing on flexibility rather than raw performance.

## Features
- **Customizable Components**: Easily switch between different feature extractors, trackers, and optimizers using the provided templates.
- **Support for Major Libraries**: Integrates with Sophus, g2o, Ceres, and OpenCV to ensure a versatile and adaptable development environment.
- **Launch File Execution**: Comes with a ROS2 launch file for easy startup and configuration.

### Extractor
- [x] ORB

### Tracker
- [x] Optical flow
